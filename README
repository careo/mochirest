This a demo of using rails UI against a erlang/mochiweb rest/json backend.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need erlang installed then

$ make
$ ./start.sh

In another window

$ cd rails
$ script/server

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/documents

What you will see is CRUD of Document objects (active resource) persisting
to a mochiweb json rest service.

The bulk of the (rather simple IMO) erlang code is in src/mochirest_web.erl
